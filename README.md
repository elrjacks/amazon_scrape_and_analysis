## BeautifulSoup web scraping and Analysis

### Why?
Having coding skills is truly amazing, especially when faced with everyday problems. 
One such problem I encountered was finding the perfect espresso machine to purchase from Amazon. 
It seems like a common issue I've come across frequently, trying to assess which product will fit my needs. To tackle it efficiently, 
I started creating spreadsheets to keep track of various items, including their prices, ratings, features, and links, among other details. 
However, this process became time-consuming, and I wanted to find the best option without spending months on the decision-making process. 
Consequently, I developed a program that automates the entire process, providing me with the crème de la crème choices.
